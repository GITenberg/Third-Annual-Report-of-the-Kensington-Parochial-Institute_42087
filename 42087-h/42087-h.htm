ANNUAL REPORT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Council of the Parochial
Institute have pleasure in submitting for the adoption of its
members, and the consideration of the inhabitants of Kensington,
their Third Annual Report.</p>
<p>Having upon former occasions detailed the circumstances of its
formation, and demonstrated upon solid grounds the expediency of
meeting the increasing intellectual requirements of the
community, by the establishment, throughout the country, of
societies for the diffusion of a healthy literature, and a
cultivated taste, it will be their present purpose to recount
their own success in stimulating these objects, while suggesting
to their fellow residents the privilege, policy, and duty of
enabling them to develop the existing agencies of mental
recreation, by liberally conceding to their claims an united and
comprehensive support.</p>
<p>Nor will such a retrospect be interesting only to those more
immediately concerned in producing the results recorded.&nbsp;
The popular use of reading-rooms, libraries, and lectures, is not
connected with questions of merely individual or local
importance; it is of imperial bearing: for while their
multiplication and prosperity afford criteria for determining how
far the desire of knowledge animates the people, indifference to
learning and incapacity for self-instruction are attested by
their failure or neglect.&nbsp; These are amongst the outward
manifestations of those unconscious tendencies by which the
philosophical observer estimates the bent and genius of the
age.&nbsp; As in the multitudes who throng to gaze upon the line
of armies man&oelig;uvring in the pomp of mimic war, he reads the
love of military glory, if not the lust of conquest; as in an
inordinate devotion to games, and theatres, and spectacles, he
sees the traits of frivolity; so in the steady application of the
faculties to the improvement <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of the mind he recognises the
characteristics of a wise and understanding people.&nbsp; But
these diversities of national choice and temperament cannot be
consigned to the speculations of the theorist.&nbsp; They enter
largely into the deliberations of the practical statesman.&nbsp;
By their influence, the distribution of political power is
confessedly affected.&nbsp; Rights that could not be confided to
an ignorant, are freely accorded to an educated population.&nbsp;
Already the principle of an educational qualification has been
mooted as the safest mode in which the extension of the franchise
could be granted; and in considering the claims of various
constituencies to a participation in the representation of the
country, it is far from impossible that the government would
accord a preference to localities, maintaining in efficiency and
prominence well organized institutions of social and intellectual
progress.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to reflect that this neighbourhood need not
shrink from such an inquiry.&nbsp; For though its growth has been
unprecedentedly rapid for the last ten years, private liberality
and public munificence have combined to preserve its ancient
pre-eminence over other suburban parishes.&nbsp; It is still in
truth, as well as name, &ldquo;the Royal Ville&rdquo; of
Kensington.&nbsp; But whilst it is creditable to its patriotism
that it has erected, within this recent period, four new
churches, has built a dispensary, and raised other public
structures of much architectural merit and of great utility;
whilst in these edifices, dedicated to the noblest ends, religion
and humanity, evidences are shrined of an enlightened and active
desire of improvement, no attempt commensurate with the
importance of the town has yet been made to purchase or erect a
building where neighbour may meet neighbour in a spirit of
good-will and unity, and by intercourse and the exchange of daily
courtesy, and the pursuit of knowledge, which civilizes and
blesses parishes as well as nations, communities as well as
individuals, and which ought ever to be found in alliance with
religion itself.</p>
<p>Kensington, central Kensington, with its parks, and gardens,
and palace, the birthplace and residence of monarchs, rich in
historical associations, almost the home of genius; where
Cromwell swayed the destinies of <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Europe; where William of Orange
sojourned, Lord Chancellor Nottingham dwelt, Sir Christopher Wren
planned and built, and Sir Isaac Newton solved the problems of
astronomy; where George II.&rsquo;s children played, and Queen
Victoria was born; which is linked in memory with the names of
Addison, Horner, Canning, Wellesley, Moore, Wilkie, and
Wilberforce, and still retains within its limits some of the most
distinguished authors and artists of the day, possesses no Public
Museum, no Public Library, not even a Lecture-Hall.</p>
<p>But though it be a matter of shame and disgrace that this
omission has never been adequately supplied, much of the
substantial advantage attached to the Athen&aelig;ums of the
manufacturing towns, and the Biblioth&egrave;ques of the
continental cities, has been modestly provided by the Parochial
Institute.</p>
<p>Small though its reading-rooms unquestionably are, situated in
a street removed from the central thoroughfare, and of outward
appearance but little in unison with the wealth, respectability,
and literary reputation of St. Mary Abbott&rsquo;s, they still
are known and patronized.&nbsp; From the date of their opening,
three years ago, they have been becoming more and more
frequented.&nbsp; At first they were attended only by those who
had joined the Institution with the wish to encourage so good a
work.&nbsp; Now they are subscribed to by many who appreciate
their convenience for their own sake.&nbsp; This is a wholesome
sign&mdash;the turning point of success in such an
undertaking.&nbsp; For though it be necessary and right to bring
to bear upon an infant project all the extraneous aid that can
promote its object, no factitious support will permanently
avail.&nbsp; To ensure a prolonged existence, it must be
sustained by its own merits.&nbsp; It is not till interest comes
to strengthen principle that the prosperous future is
secured.&nbsp; But in a country constantly and triumphantly
calling attention to the freedom and purity of its press, it can
hardly be necessary to expatiate on the benefits accruing from
its wide and impartial circulation.&nbsp; From the publication of
Milton&rsquo;s Areopagetica, these have been acknowledged.&nbsp;
None can say how much the English habit of reading newspapers
tends to enlarge the national views.&nbsp; Men cannot see, day
after day, the <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>various problems of political and social moment, debated
before them by the ablest advocates, without confessing that
cogent reasons may be urged on either side.&nbsp; Half an hour
spent daily in perusing the current reviews and magazines is
usefully employed.&nbsp; By it the mind is kept informed of the
events of contemporaneous history, is enabled to form an
independent judgment upon measures requiring the sifting of
discussion, and led to correct, modify, or expand any sentiments
too carelessly adopted, too obstinately defended, or too narrowly
based.</p>
<p>Thus silently, it may be, and unconsciously, prejudice
succumbs to reason, party strife is mitigated, and argument, not
force, enthroned the constituted arbiter of conflicting
wills.&nbsp; Hence arises the desirableness of a Newsroom in
every populous place, in which each phase of opinion may be
represented by its own peculiar organ.&nbsp; Few private
establishments enjoy this privilege&mdash;most persons confine
themselves to a single journal, entertaining ideas precisely
identical with their own.&nbsp; They have consequently nothing
but a reflection of themselves.&nbsp; They lose the advantage of
filtrating their notions through other minds.&nbsp; Of old it was
said, &ldquo;beware of the man of one book.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
man of one paper is infinitely worse.&nbsp; He usually fails to
rise above the natural tendency to a contracted sphere of
thought, and rapidly subsides into a state of one-sided
conviction, as illiberal, as it is irrational.&nbsp; This is a
trial to which no sensible inquirer after truth would willingly
subject himself.&nbsp; On the contrary, he will concur in
forwarding any plan to obviate its danger.&nbsp; The Parochial
Institute embodies such a plan.&nbsp; Therefore, he will enrol
himself upon its list of members.</p>
<p>It must not, however, be supposed that facility of access to
the ephemeral publications is either the sole or the main
intention of this Society.&nbsp; For whatever necessity exists
for affording to the industrial and operative bodies
opportunities of consulting periodicals of approved ability,
morality, and loyalty, it can only be subordinate to the study of
more substantial literature.&nbsp; Experience demonstrates that
the habit of reading once acquired, is seldom lost.&nbsp; No
obstacle ought consequently to be suffered to interfere with its
attainment.&nbsp; The incipient student should be free to range
the entire field of knowledge.&nbsp; All that its ample page
contains, should be <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>unfolded for his choice.&nbsp; And though his early
flights be wild, his attempts discursive, he will gradually
contract his circle, and settle down at last.&nbsp; This has been
instructively verified by some of the quarterly subscribers,
whose thirst for light reading was at first excessive.&nbsp;
Three sets of novels per week scarcely sufficed to satisfy this
eager craving.&nbsp; Now all this is changed.&nbsp; The catalogue
of books procured from Churton&rsquo;s, for 1852, shows a most
remarkable diminution in works of a romantic character.&nbsp;
Even those demanded, are of a higher and better
description.&nbsp; But the staple orders consist of travels,
biographies, histories, and treatises on religion.&nbsp; Such
facts throw light upon the probable working of free
libraries.&nbsp; They bear out the belief, that if judiciously
selected, and kept up by successive additions of modern writers,
a numerous attendance and issue might be expected.&nbsp; Nor
would such an enterprise be attended by any ruinous
expense.&nbsp; Excellent histories are now published for three
shillings a volume, while the pamphlets on miscellaneous
subjects, currently known under the name of Literature for the
Rail, embrace some of the most interesting essays, travels, and
disquisitions in the language.&nbsp; The Council would bring this
topic strongly before their fellow-parishioners, in the hope of
inducing many to make presents in augmentation of the library
that they now possess.&nbsp; Its after increase can be only a
question of time.&nbsp; A free library is the corollary and
supplement of national education.&nbsp; Other parishes are
beginning to understand this.&nbsp; Liverpool, Manchester, and
Birmingham are setting a good example.&nbsp; Marylebone is about
to follow in the same wise path.&nbsp; It is too palpable an
error, to give the people an appetite for reading without
furnishing them with the means of satisfying it, for a long
continuance, in a country so practical as England.&nbsp; Only let
it be admitted, and the remedy will not be withheld.&nbsp; May
Kensington take the initiative in its rectification by applying
it to its own requirements.</p>
<p>But the readiest access to books, the most unwearied
diligence, and the highest ability are not enough to render one
man independent in a scientific inquiry of the discoveries of
another.&nbsp; The more the philosopher investigates the unseen
causes of visible things, the more he is compelled to have
recourse to a division of labour.&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Human life and human memory are alike
unable to grasp an universal knowledge.&nbsp; Hence the acutest
intellects devote their powers to master definite departments of
science.&nbsp; They do not aim at an impossible
omniscience.&nbsp; Relying on the truth and ability of their
collaborators, they receive their conclusions as their own.&nbsp;
Nor are these communicated commonly in special treatises, but
through the more familiar media of lectures.&nbsp; On such
occasions, he who is the teacher of to-day, is not too proud to
be the pupil of to-morrow.&nbsp; Faraday, Murchison, Owen, and
Herschell sit alternately at each other&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; But
if this be true of these hierophants of nature, what shall be
said of her neophytes?&nbsp; It is clear that to those engaged in
following their craft, their trade, or their profession, time is
a main object.&nbsp; But if they cannot unravel processes, they
fain would know results.&nbsp; These are easily attainable by the
method above mentioned.&nbsp; A good lecture will oftentimes
simplify abstruse problems, and make intelligible the most
complicated machine, when books and diagrams convey no
comprehensible meaning.&nbsp; Perhaps no literary association in
the metropolis can bear witness to this fact with a more vivid
realization of its accuracy then our own.&nbsp; Since the
publication of the last report, we have been familiarized with
the wonders of creation in all the kingdoms of nature.&nbsp; With
Mantell, we have read the records of primeval worlds, traced by
the finger of omnipotence in those fossilized remains, which mock
the palaces of Nineveh with their recent age.&nbsp; With Morris,
gathered up the laws that regulate the distribution of the
springs and waters of the earth, and learnt how man can call its
spirit from the chalky deeps for purposes of use or
ornament.&nbsp; With Noad, investigated the phenomena of
light.&nbsp; With Wheeler, ranged from star to star throughout
the immensity of space.&nbsp; With Weld, explored the coasts and
channels, creeks and bays of those inhospitable regions which,
clustering round the Northern Pole, guard with indomitable
tenacity the Western Passage, despite the energy, endurance, and
perseverance of the hardiest adventurers.&nbsp; With Pettigrew,
examined the internal structure of the microscopic insect.&nbsp;
With Scoresby, marvelled at the physical organization of the
whole.&nbsp; One voice, which we had hoped to hear, was
silent.&nbsp; Severe <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>indisposition postponed for ever Professor Cowper&rsquo;s
explanation of the cotton-mill.&nbsp; Since then, both he and Dr.
Mantell have been summoned to their rest.&nbsp; In the one,
practical art laments its clearest elucidator; in the other,
science mourns her most attractive commentator; in both, the
Parochial Institute has sustained a grievous loss.&nbsp; Yet
amongst its pleasantest associations must ever rank the
recollections of their lectures.&nbsp; The idiomatic phraseology,
homeliness of illustration, unaffected delivery, and telling
earnestness of Professor Cowper, who by this very ease of manner
beguiled you into the idea that you were actually learning
<i>with</i> him, not <i>from</i> him, will be blended in the
memory with Mantell&rsquo;s graceful elocution, refined imagery,
and enthusiastic love of his favourite study, by the combined
force of which he carried his audience with him, and led their
thoughts from nature up to nature&rsquo;s God.&nbsp; Alike
disinterested in character, alike confident in the victory of
knowledge over ignorance, alike the firm and generous promoters
of infant institutions founded to ensure this end, they shone as
twin stars in our local firmament, bright examples to the
possessors of similar endowments to consecrate their use with the
same unostentatious perseverance to the cause of goodness,
civilization and truth, bright examples to all as fosterers by
personal exertion as well as by pecuniary sacrifice of parochial
societies appealing to every moral and patriotic feeling for
extension and support.&nbsp; For the many lectures that he
delivered in Kensington, Mr. Cowper never accepted any
remuneration.&nbsp; Dr. Mantell gave his services for half his
customary fee.&nbsp; Not, however, that they are the sole
instances of this discriminating benevolence.&nbsp; To Mr. Weld
and Dr. Scoresby, the cordial acknowledgments of the Council are
equally due and tendered for gratuitous addresses.&nbsp; In
contrasting their generous dedication of time, convenience, and
ability to the task of popular enlightenment, with the selfish
spirit that repudiates whatever is not subservient to personal
benefit or gratification, it is impossible to overlook the
elevating influence of mental culture.&nbsp; Of all the pleas for
indifference to, or withdrawal from an association for diffusing
useful and scientific information, none is so unworthy, so
sordid, or so mean as that commonest of excuses, &ldquo;<i>It
does me no good</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Such an
allegation can only arise from a most short-sighted policy.&nbsp;
For, let individual preference be what it may, the time is past
for saying to the advancing tide of scientific inquisition,
&ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
incessant discoveries and inventions of modern years have
quickened with the throes of mental energy the masses of the
nation.&nbsp; Its strong sense is alive to the power of
knowledge, and circulates from the head to the extremities of the
social body.&nbsp; The magnetic experiments, to which the whole
philosophical world is looking with the most intense curiosity,
are conducted by one who entered life a shop-boy.&nbsp; The
solution of deep metaphysical propositions is not without
attraction to the hard-headed ratiocination of the operatives of
Lancashire.&nbsp; There are those who have wrestled out; by
abstract reasoning, the cardinal verity of the immortality of the
soul.&nbsp; The mechanics of London number in their ranks many
ardent thinkers.&nbsp; When the recent lecture on cohesion and
gravitation was delivered at the Museum of Practical Geology, so
large an audience of working men was collected, that, though the
issue of tickets had been purposely increased, upwards of two
hundred persons were refused admission at the door.&nbsp; Now it
is folly to ignore this spirit of investigation.&nbsp; You may
guide, you may control, but can neither deny nor crush it.&nbsp;
Wisely, therefore, has the government recognised its prevalence;
wisely has the Queen recommended in her speech from the throne,
its association with practical art; and wisely will those towns
and cities act which avail themselves of whatever facilities the
legislature may decide upon offering, to give it salutary scope
and exercise.&nbsp; In a circular forwarded from the Society of
Arts to the different Institutes of England, a series of
questions was proposed in reference to this end.&nbsp; The
answers returned by the Council will be found in the Appendix,
for the information of members and others, who will then
understand how real the movement is, and how great is the
expediency of frankly and heartily ensuring its success.&nbsp;
Should the suggestions contained in this document be approved and
carried into execution, they can hardly fail to give an impulse
to self-instruction; while the annual exhibition of models,
inventions, and machinery, would afford an opportunity for the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>social
intercourse and mutual improvement ordinarily attached to the
pleasant enjoyment of an evening conversazione.</p>
<p>But are these aids to rational recreation really brought
within the reach of the industrial population?&nbsp; Can the
apprentices and shopmen of Kensington afford to join the
Institute?&nbsp; Is not the cost of membership too expensive for
their purse?&nbsp; Such can hardly be the case.&nbsp; Admission
to the reading-room, library, and lectures is accorded to
subscribers of half-a-crown a quarter; while a yearly payment of
one guinea gives its donor a voice in the government of the
society.&nbsp; The analysis of these sums shows a result of less
than a half-penny a day for the former, and of under sixpence a
week to the latter class of contribution.&nbsp; Frugality itself
cannot object to such a scale.&nbsp; Taken individually, the
advantages are worth their price;&mdash;collectively, they are
emphatically a bargain.</p>
<p>Subsidiary to the main channels of intellectual culture, are
the Elementary Evening Classes, held at the Church-court school,
under the superintendence of two masters from Battersea
College.&nbsp; They were instituted for the sake of the young
persons who are unable to attend the day schools, and include a
due proportion of adults.&nbsp; The class for young men and boys
meets upon Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday; that for young women
and girls on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.&nbsp; The attendances
to the close of 1852 were very satisfactory; 120 girls and 40
boys having enrolled themselves upon the books.&nbsp; An
interesting peculiarity connected with the female class is its
use by servants whose education has been neglected.&nbsp; Several
who could neither read nor write on their first entrance, have
attained a tolerable proficiency in these subjects; and of those
who have grown up to age for service, and taken situations, some
have been wise enough to return during their intervals of
employment, to pursue the studies with which the duties of their
place had necessarily for the season interfered.&nbsp; The
subjects now taught are limited to reading, writing, arithmetic,
and geography.&nbsp; But it is proposed to add music; and should
the Society of Arts carry out its principles in this parish,
linear drawing, languages, geometry, and mathematics would also
be encouraged, were a sufficient number of names <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>inscribed to
constitute a remunerating class.&nbsp; The payment for the
present course is two-pence weekly, in advance; but
proportionably higher fees would be required to ensure the
services of masters capable of conducting the higher branches of
education.</p>
<p>If these facilities for instruction are not accepted to the
full extent that might, prior to experience, have been expected,
it ought not to check the genial philanthropy by which they are
provided.&nbsp; All that we can do is to offer privileges.&nbsp;
It rests with others to turn their use to profit.&nbsp; And if,
in the attempt to raise the social and mental position of those
who minister to our daily wants, we are unable to achieve all
that we desire, it is still a noble and a worthy ambition,
warranting the sacrifice of some prejudices and the risk of many
disappointments, to endeavour so to order the arrangement of our
literary and scientific agencies that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our needful knowledge, like our needful
food,<br />
Unhedged lie open in life&rsquo;s common field,<br />
And bid all welcome to the vital feast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chief advantages which might be
expected to result from a combination of the Provincial
Institutes with the Society of Arts would be, in our opinion, the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&alpha;.&nbsp; The formation of a Central Library, from which
Local Institutes might, from time to time, borrow supplies of
Books on the same or more reasonable terms than they can now
procure them from the large circulating libraries of the
metropolis.</p>
<p>&beta;.&nbsp; A staff of Lecturers might be provided by the
Society of Arts, competent to give interesting and instructive
information in a popular form; such staff to be selected by a
Council, who, from their position and attainments, would be
entitled to general confidence.&nbsp; Each Provincial Institute
might be allowed to choose its own Lecturers from this staff,
without being necessarily restricted to it.</p>
<p>&gamma;.&nbsp; The models, diagrams, &amp;c., now provided by
the individual lecturers at a considerable expense, and often
with great personal trouble, might be furnished by the Society
from a central repository established for that purpose.&nbsp;
Many of the articles required, particularly drawings and
diagrams, would probably be executed by the students of the
School of Design, who would thus possess an opportunity for the
practical exercise of their art.</p>
<p>&delta;.&nbsp; That useful inventions and apparatus might be
exhibited in the various localities of the Metropolitan and
Provincial Institutes; and if the specimens were only shown for a
short time in each <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>place, a small number of each article would
suffice.&nbsp; These circulating exhibitions would probably be
attractive, and perhaps excite more notice than permanent
museums.&nbsp; The Society of Arts might lend the articles for
exposition gratuitously or at a low price, on condition that the
Institute supplied the room, and made itself responsible for loss
or damage.</p>
<p>&epsilon;.&nbsp; That each Institute, in its collective
capacity, would be considered so far affiliated to the various
Scientific, Literary, and Philosophical Societies, as to receive
annually, on application, a copy of the Transactions, and as many
tickets, for attending Meetings and Lectures, as each Society may
find it convenient to allow.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
